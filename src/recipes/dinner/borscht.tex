\subsection{Ingredients}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 500g beetroot, peeled and cut into matchsticks (reserve a small piece to grate into the soup at the end)
    \item 2 medium onions, sliced into half-moons
    \item 2 large carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks
    \item 400g white cabbage, cut thinly into shreds
    \item 2 tbsp olive oil
    \item 5 cups vegetable stock
    \item Juice of half a lemon
    \item Sour cream (optional, omit for vegan soup)
    \item Finely chopped parsley or chives (optional, for garnish)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Method}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Saut√© onions, carrots, and beets over medium heat in the olive oil with a pinch of salt in a large soup pot, reserving a small amount of raw beet to grate and add near the end to enliven the color.
    \item In the meantime, bring the vegetable stock to a boil. When the vegetables are soft (about 5 minutes), add the shredded cabbage and the hot stock. Bring to a boil and simmer 15-25 minutes, until the vegetables are tender. With a few minutes left, add the reserved grated beet.    
    \item Season to taste with salt and pepper, then squeeze in the lemon juice, aiming for a pleasing but subtle sour taste. Serve with freshly ground black pepper, a dollop of sour cream, and chopped parsley, if desired.
\end{enumerate}
