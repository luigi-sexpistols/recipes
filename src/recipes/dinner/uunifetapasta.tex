\subsection{Ingredients}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 400g good pasta
    \item 400g feta cheese (Greek/crumbly, \emph{not Danish/silky})
    \item 20mL olive oil
    \item 3 box cherry tomatoes
    \item 1\sfrac{1}{2} tsp "Italian" herbs
    \item pepper
    \item pinch of salt
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Method}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Put the feta centrally in a baking dish (e.g. lasagne dish) and surround with the tomatoes. Sprinkle the herbs, salt, and pepper, then drizzle with olive oil, giving the tomatoes a quick stir to coat them.
    \item Start the pasta in cold water over high heat.
    \item Place the feta/tomato dish in a \celsius{200} oven for 15 minutes.
    \item After the 15 minutes is up, raise the oven to \celsius{225} for a further 10-20 minutes. The feta should start to get some nice browning and the tomatoes should be nicely soft.
    \item Drain the pasta, reserving 1-2 cups of the water to thicken the sauce shortly.
    \item Dump the pasta and 1 cup of the water into the baking dish and mix together until the sauce emulsifies and becomes creamy. Use more pasta water as needed.
\end{enumerate}
