\begin{enumerate}
    \item Cut chicken into large strips (3-4 per breast) and fry over
    high heat until nicely browned. Underdone is fine for now, it
    will finish cooking later. Set aside.

    nicely browned. Set aside.
    \item Finely chop onion and saut√© over medium heat until starting
    to soften. Add garlic, continue cooking until onion is soft and
    brown.
    \item When chicken has cooled enough to handle, cut into bite-
    sized cubes.
    \item Add coconut cream, stock, mushrooms, and chicken to pot,
    raise heat to high.
    \item Add spinach, stirring until it wilts into the liquid.
    \item When the pot reaches a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook,
    uncovered, for 1 hour.
    \item Serve with rice, with a sambal on the side.
