\subsection{Ingredients}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 500g plain pork or beef sausages, cut into 1cm pieces
    \item 2 onions, diced finely
    \item 2 carrots, diced finely
    \item 2 stalks celery, diced finely
    \item 3 cloves garlic, minced
    \item \sfrac{1}{4} cup tomato paste
    \item 1\sfrac{1}{2} cups vegetable or beef stock
    \item 1 cup milk (or cream)
    \item 2 tsp Italian herb mix
    \item 1 head broccoli, florets only
    \item Pasta, for serving
    \item Parmesan cheese, for serving
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Method}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Brown the sausages over medium-high heat. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside for now.
    \item Saute the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic in a large pot over medium heat until soft and starting to brown slightly.
    \item Add the tomato paste and cook until the ``raw'' smell disappears (about a minute).
    \item Return the sausages to the pan, along with the stock, milk, herbs, and remaining vegetables. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for 2-3 hours.
    \item Serve with pasta and garnish with parmesan cheese.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Notes}

The milk may separate alarmingly and the solids show as a white powdery substance. Ignore this, it should re-incorporate without any problems as it cooks.
