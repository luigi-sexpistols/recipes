\subsection{Ingredients}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 600g pork belly, cut into 1" cubes
    \item 250mL Shaoxing rice wine
    \item 2 tbsp light soy sauce
    \item 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
    \item 5 slices ginger
    \item 2 star-anise pods
    \item 2 bay leaves
    \item 20g rock sugar or 1 tbsp regular sugar
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Method}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Put the pork in a pot and cover with cold water, then bring to a boil over high heat. Skim the scum with a spoon, then drain the meat and rinse under running water.
    \item Put the pork back in the pot and barely cover with hot water, then add the rest of the ingredients (except the sugar). Bring to a boil and then simmer, covered, over low heat for 90 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    \item Remove the lid, add the sugar, and raise the heat to the highest setting. Stir occasionally until the sauce reduces to just cover the bottom of the pot.
    \item Serve with rice and vegetable dishes.
\end{enumerate}
