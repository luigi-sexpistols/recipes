\subsection{Ingredients}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 250g Chinese broccoli (Gai Lan)
    \item 1 tbsp neutral cooking oil
    \item 1 tsp minced ginger
    \item 1 tsp minced garlic
    \item 1 tsp Shaoxing rice wine
    \item \sfrac{1}{2} tsp sugar
    \item \sfrac{1}{4} tsp salt
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Method}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Wash Chinese broccoli thoroughly. Trim off the hard ends of the stems. Discard any yellowish leaves. Slice diagonally into small pieces.
    \item Warm up the wok over medium-high heat until smoking hot. Pour in oil. Add ginger and garlic to sizzle until fragrant (do not burn).
    \item Put in the Chinese broccoli. Toss well to evenly coat it with the oil. Add Shaoxing rice wine. Cover with a lid immediately and leave to steam for about 1 minute.
    \item Remove the lid. Season with salt and sugar. Toss and stir for a further 30 seconds or so. Taste to check the doneness. The stem part should be cooked but still crunchy to bite.
\end{enumerate}
