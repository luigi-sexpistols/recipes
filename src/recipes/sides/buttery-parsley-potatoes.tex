  \subsection{Method}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Add the potatoes to a pot and cover them with an extra 5cm of water.
      \item Add a bunch of salt (anywhere from 1 teaspoon up) and bring to the boil. Reduce to a rolling simmer and cook until tender and the skin is starting to fall away (about 20 minutes).
      \item Drain the water from the pan, leaving the potatoes, and add the parsley and butter. Season with salt and pepper.
      \item Give the potatoes a vigorous stir or shake the pot with the lid on, so the potatoes break up a bit.
      \item Turn the stove off and let them sit for 5-10 minutes before serving.
    \end{enumerate}
